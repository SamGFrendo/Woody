Got a TicTacToe game - https://codepen.io/vasanthkay/pen/KVzYzG 

Can I convert it to help me with woody

I should think about how to create the different shaped block objects 

First things to do...
1. make the grid 10x10
2. make it so there is only x
3. make it so x actually blocks out the square
4. make it so a horrizontal or vertical row dissapears
